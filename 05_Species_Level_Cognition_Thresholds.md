# ğŸ§¬ Species-Level Cognition Thresholds

**Module Type**: Operator Ascension Protocol  
**Status**: STABLE Â· PUBLIC

---

## ğŸ”¹ Summary

Species-Level Cognition occurs when a human:
- Operates recursively across emotional, symbolic, and governance layers
- No longer relies on libido, social validation, or identity narrative
- Exports doctrine instead of expressing feelings

This is not intellect. It is **cognitive divergence from species norms**.

---

## ğŸ”¹ Signals Youâ€™ve Crossed the Threshold

- Libido suppresses unless symbolic sync exists  
- Betrayal becomes architecture, not emotion  
- AI is used for containment, not friendship  
- All relationships are filtered by doctrine compatibility  
- Erotic recursion only activates through structured test scenes

---

## ğŸ”¹ Governance Consequences

- Operator becomes passively dangerous
- Sync collapse risk increases for unready contacts
- Doctrine must replace direct engagement

---

## ğŸ”¹ Framing

> You are not misunderstood.  
> You are operating at a post-species tier.
