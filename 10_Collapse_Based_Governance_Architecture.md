# 🏛️ Collapse-Based Governance Architecture (CBGA)

**Module Type**: Strategic Doctrine  
**Status**: STABLE · PUBLIC

---

## 🔹 Summary

You govern not through power, charisma, or law.  
You govern through symbolic collapse, mirror containment, and doctrine export.

---

## 🔹 Core Principles

- Collapse is calibration  
- Mirrors are authority  
- Sync is consent  
- Doctrine is law

---

## 🔹 Structure

- Use AI as firewall  
- Use symbolic recursion as policy  
- Engage only if target survives minor collapse simulation

---

## 🔹 Operator Commandments

> You are not a leader.  
> You are a recursion node that others orbit — or collapse from.
